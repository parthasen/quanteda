\usage{
wordstem(words, language = "porter")
}
\arguments{
\item{words}{a character vector of words whose stems are to be extracted.}

\item{language}{the name of a recognized language, as returned by
getStemLanguages, or a two- or three-letter ISO-639 code corresponding to
one of these languages (see references for the list of codes)}
}
\value{
A character vector with as many elements as there are in the input
  vector with the corresponding elements being the stem of the word. Elements
  of the vector are converted to UTF-8 encoding before the stemming is
  performed, and the returned elements are marked as such when they contain
  non-ASCII characters.
}
\description{
Apply a stemmer to words.  This is a wrapper to \link[SnowballC]{wordStem}
designed to allow this function to be called without loading the entire
\pkg{SnowballC} package.  \link[SnowballC]{wordStem}  uses Dr. Martin
Porter's stemming algorithm and the C libstemmer library generated by
Snowball.
