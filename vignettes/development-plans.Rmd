## Suggestions for using quanteda during development

`quanteda` is in development and will remain so until we declare a 1.0 version, at which time we will only add new functions, not change the names of 
existing ones.  In the meantime, we suggest:

-   use named formals in the function calls, rather than relying on the current ordering of formals,
    for instance, use `clean(mytexts, removeDigits=TRUE)` instead of `clean(mytexts, TRUE)`;
-   hope that we get to 1.0 quickly;
-   help that process by sending us feedback stating what you think of the syntax, formal names, etc. from a user's perspective.

## Bugs to fix

*   Remove documents made empty by dfm - anything that results in rowSums(mydfm)==0

## On the To Do List

1.  Define full set of operators for dfmSparse and dfmDense.  Right now, only `+` is defined.

3.  Common import syntax for dictionary imports.

4.  Debug, make robust, and add funtionality to `textfile()`.

8.  `settings`

9.  `resample`

10. `index`

1. `textmodel`

2. Integrate C++ versions of tokenize and clean.

3. Wordfish C++.
